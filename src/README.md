# Aardwolf Legacy

The Aardwolf Legacy Arbitrage Platform

## Disclaimer

This is a lot of my old code.  
I'm making no promises of profit.  



## Current State

There's a significant amount of work to do to bring this back into a working state.  
Most of what's here uses .NET Framework.  

Many of these libraries have already been migrated to .NET Core / .NET 5 in other repos.  

### Exchange Changes

Exchanges change their APIs frequently.  
Many of the exchange integrations represented here aren't going to work.

### Not going to build

This solution relies on nuget packages in other repos that lived on a home machine.  
I'll see if I can get those restored here.  

In the meatime, this solution is not going to build.
